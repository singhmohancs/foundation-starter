# Foundation starter project

## Installation

To use this template, your computer needs:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) (0.12 or greater)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)

This template can be installed with the Foundation CLI, or downloaded and set up manually.

### Using the CLI

Install the Foundation CLI with this command:

```bash
npm install foundation-cli --global
```

### Project Setup

```bash
git clone https://github.com/singhmohancs/foundation-starter.git
```

Then open the folder in your command line, and install the needed dependencies:

```bash
cd foundation-starter
npm install
bower install
```

Finally, run `npm start` to run the Sass compiler. It will re-run every time you save a Sass file.

To create compressed, production-ready assets, run `npm run build`.
